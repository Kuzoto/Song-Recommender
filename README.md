Setup
Usage
!Run all commands in the root directory(i.e. Song-Recommender)!
!Though it shouldn't cause any issues I recommend not running load_csv till you have ran specs and slices!
!Double check your CUDA version and make sure that you have pytorch+cuda installed, this model trains and runs very slow on CPU!
